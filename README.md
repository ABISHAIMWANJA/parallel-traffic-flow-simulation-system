# parallel-traffic-flow-simulation-system

This project contains a simple hybrid traffic simulation that combines shared-memory parallelism (OpenMP) with a simulated distributed model for intersections. It was created for *COMP 412 – Parallel and Distributed Systems* to illustrate how road segments and intersections can be processed concurrently.
